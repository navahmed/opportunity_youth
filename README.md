# South King County Opportunity Youth Analysis

In order to identify the opportunity youth in South King County Washington, we initially identified the cities in South King County and worked out the PUMA IDs based on the city names.

Once we had this, we ran another SQL query using those PUMA IDs so that we can extract the demographic data for the cities in the region.

Using this, we ran our analysis.
